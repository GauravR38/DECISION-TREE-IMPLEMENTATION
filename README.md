# DESCRIPTION

# Traffic Accident Prediction using Decision Trees

This project implements a **Decision Tree classifier** to predict traffic accidents based on various environmental and road conditions. The model is built using Python's scikit-learn library and is designed to provide interpretable insights into the factors contributing to accidents.

# Key Features

**Dataset**: Uses a traffic accident dataset with features like weather conditions, road type, lighting, and more.

**Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and splits data into training/testing sets.

**Model**: A Decision Tree classifier with configurable hyperparameters (max_depth, min_samples_split, etc.).

**Evaluation**: Metrics include accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

**Visualization**: Decision Tree structure and feature importance plots for interpretability.

# Workflow

**Data Loading**: Load and inspect the dataset.

**Preprocessing**: Clean missing values, encode categorical features, and split data.

**Model Training**: Train a Decision Tree classifier on the training set.

**Evaluation**: Evaluate the model on the test set using accuracy and other metrics.

**Visualization**: Visualize the Decision Tree and feature importance.

**Analysis**: Interpret the model results and suggest improvements.

# Results

Achieved **X% accuracy** on the test set.

Top important features: Feature1, Feature2, Feature3.

Decision Tree depth limited to **X levels** for interpretability.

# Usage

Clone the repository:

**git clone https://github.com/your-username/traffic-accident-prediction.git**

Install dependencies:

**pip install -r requirements.txt**

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

**jupyter notebook traffic_accident_prediction.ipynb**

# Dependencies

**Python 3.x**

Libraries: **pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn**

# Future Improvements

Experiment with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

Handle class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE.

Extend the model to include time-based features (e.g., hour, weekday).
